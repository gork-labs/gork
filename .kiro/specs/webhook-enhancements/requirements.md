# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to enhance the existing webhook implementation in the Gork framework. The current webhook system provides a solid foundation with Stripe integration, but requires improvements in areas such as additional provider support, enhanced error handling, better observability, and improved developer experience. The webhook system should maintain Gork's convention-over-configuration philosophy while providing enterprise-grade reliability and extensibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating webhooks from multiple providers, I want support for additional webhook providers beyond Stripe, so that I can handle webhooks from various services using a consistent API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a new webhook provider THEN the system SHALL provide a clear interface pattern following the existing WebhookHandler interface
2. WHEN adding new webhook providers THEN the system SHALL handle their specific signature verification mechanisms
3. WHEN registering multiple providers THEN each SHALL be independently configurable with their own secrets and validation rules
4. WHEN a provider is added THEN it SHALL automatically integrate with the OpenAPI documentation generation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer handling webhook failures, I want enhanced error handling, so that webhook processing errors are properly managed and logged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including event type, provider, and failure reason
2. WHEN signature verification fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error responses
3. WHEN user metadata validation fails THEN the system SHALL handle strict vs non-strict validation modes appropriately
4. WHEN webhook events fail processing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for debugging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring webhook processing, I want basic logging capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot webhook issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN webhook events are received THEN the system SHALL log structured information including provider, event type, and processing status
2. WHEN webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL log error details for debugging purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer configuring webhooks, I want improved configuration validation, so that webhook setup errors are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring webhook providers THEN the system SHALL validate configuration at startup and provide clear error messages
2. WHEN webhook endpoints are registered THEN the system SHALL validate that all required event handlers are properly configured

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer testing webhook integrations, I want enhanced testing utilities and mock providers, so that I can test webhook handling without external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests for webhook handlers THEN the system SHALL provide mock webhook providers for each supported service
2. WHEN testing webhook signature verification THEN the system SHALL provide utilities to generate valid test signatures
3. WHEN testing webhook event processing THEN the system SHALL provide factory functions for creating realistic test events

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with webhook events, I want improved type safety and event modeling, so that webhook event handling is more robust and less error-prone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining webhook event handlers THEN the system SHALL provide strongly-typed event structures for each provider
2. WHEN processing webhook events THEN the system SHALL validate event schemas against provider specifications
3. WHEN handling polymorphic events THEN the system SHALL support union types for events that can have multiple payload structures
4. WHEN working with event metadata THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe access to provider-specific and user-defined metadata
5. WHEN event structures change THEN the system SHALL provide migration utilities and backward compatibility support
