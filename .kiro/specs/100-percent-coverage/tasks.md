# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze current coverage gaps and assess testability
  - Run coverage analysis to identify specific uncovered lines in `validateSection` and `validateEventHandlerSignature`
  - Analyze whether uncovered paths can be tested with current architecture or require refactoring
  - Document the exact code paths and determine implementation strategy (test enhancement vs refactoring)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [-] 2. Implement coverage solution for validateSection function
- [x] 2.1 Attempt test enhancement approach first
  - Create test cases where validator.Var() returns non-ValidationError types
  - Test scenarios with invalid byte body data and struct validation server errors
  - Test custom validation server error scenarios and edge cases
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 1.2_

- [x] 2.2 Evaluate if refactoring is needed
  - If test enhancement doesn't achieve full coverage, assess refactoring options
  - Consider extracting validator dependencies to testable interfaces
  - Implement dependency injection if required for testability
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 1.2_

- [x] 2.3 Implement chosen solution
  - Execute either enhanced testing or refactored code with comprehensive tests
  - Ensure all conditional branches and edge cases are covered
  - Maintain backward compatibility if refactoring is performed
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.4, 1.3_

- [x] 3. Implement coverage solution for validateEventHandlerSignature function
- [x] 3.1 Attempt test enhancement approach first
  - Create test cases with wrong parameter types and non-pointer parameters
  - Test scenarios with incorrect parameter counts and invalid context types
  - Test return type validation with non-error return types and multiple return values
  - Use reflection to programmatically create invalid function signatures
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 1.3_

- [x] 3.2 Evaluate if refactoring is needed
  - If test enhancement doesn't achieve full coverage, assess refactoring options
  - Consider extracting reflection operations to testable interfaces
  - Implement dependency injection if required for testability
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 1.3_

- [x] 3.3 Implement chosen solution
  - Execute either enhanced testing or refactored code with comprehensive tests
  - Ensure all validation branches and edge cases are covered
  - Maintain backward compatibility if refactoring is performed
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 1.3_

- [x] 4. Implement test quality assurance and best practices
- [x] 4.1 Ensure test code follows project conventions
  - Review all new test code for adherence to project testing patterns
  - Implement table-driven tests where appropriate for multiple scenarios
  - Use descriptive test names that clearly indicate what is being tested
  - Add comprehensive test documentation and comments
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4_

- [x] 4.2 Validate error testing patterns
  - Ensure all error tests verify both error occurrence and specific error messages
  - Implement proper error type assertions and validation
  - Test error wrapping and context propagation
  - Use realistic test data that represents actual usage scenarios
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.2, 4.6_

- [x] 4.3 Verify test reliability and maintainability
  - Ensure tests are deterministic and don't depend on external systems
  - Validate that tests don't introduce flaky behavior
  - Check that test data is realistic and representative
  - Verify tests are readable and maintainable
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 4.5, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Verify coverage achievement and validate implementation
- [x] 5.1 Run comprehensive coverage analysis
  - Execute `make coverage` to verify all modules reach 100% coverage
  - Generate coverage reports to confirm no missing coverage remains
  - Validate that any refactoring maintains existing API contracts
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [x] 5.2 Validate overall solution quality
  - Run full test suite to confirm no regressions were introduced
  - Execute linting tools to ensure code quality standards are maintained
  - Verify all tests pass consistently in CI/CD environment
  - Confirm that coverage improvement is sustainable and maintainable
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.4, 4.5_
