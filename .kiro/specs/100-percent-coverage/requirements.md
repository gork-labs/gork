# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the need to achieve 100% code coverage for the Gork framework. Currently, the project has 99.9% coverage with two specific functions requiring additional test coverage to meet the 100% threshold requirement. The project enforces strict code quality standards including 100% test coverage across all modules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Gork framework, I want to achieve 100% code coverage, so that I can ensure all code paths are tested and maintain the project's quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the coverage check is run THEN the system SHALL report 100.0% coverage for all modules
2. WHEN the `validateSection` function is tested THEN all code paths SHALL be covered including edge cases
3. WHEN the `validateEventHandlerSignature` function is tested THEN all validation branches SHALL be covered
4. WHEN the coverage report is generated THEN no functions SHALL appear in the "missing coverage" list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working on the validation system, I want comprehensive test coverage for the `validateSection` function, so that all validation scenarios are properly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing `validateSection` THEN all conditional branches SHALL be covered
2. WHEN testing error handling paths THEN all error scenarios SHALL be tested
3. WHEN testing validation logic THEN edge cases and boundary conditions SHALL be covered
4. WHEN the function processes different section types THEN all type-specific logic SHALL be tested

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on webhook functionality, I want complete test coverage for the `validateEventHandlerSignature` function, so that all signature validation scenarios are tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing `validateEventHandlerSignature` THEN all parameter validation paths SHALL be covered
2. WHEN testing return type validation THEN all return value scenarios SHALL be tested
3. WHEN testing function signature validation THEN all invalid signature cases SHALL be covered
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN all boundary conditions and error paths SHALL be tested

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining code quality, I want all new tests to follow best practices and project conventions, so that the test suite remains maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing new test cases THEN they SHALL follow the project's existing testing patterns and conventions
2. WHEN creating test data THEN it SHALL be realistic and representative of actual usage scenarios
3. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the tests SHALL verify both error occurrence and error message accuracy
4. WHEN implementing test coverage THEN the tests SHALL be readable, well-documented, and maintainable
5. WHEN adding tests THEN they SHALL not introduce flaky behavior or dependencies on external systems
6. WHEN testing validation logic THEN edge cases SHALL include boundary values, invalid inputs, and type mismatches
